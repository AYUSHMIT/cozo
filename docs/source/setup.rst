The Cozo database system is queried using the language CozoScript. At its core, CozoScript is a `Datalog <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog>`_ dialect supporting stratified negation and stratified recursive meet-aggregations. The built-in native algorithms (mainly graph algorithms) and ACID-compliant triple store further empowers CozoScript for much greater ease of use and much wider applicability compared to bare-bone Datalog.
