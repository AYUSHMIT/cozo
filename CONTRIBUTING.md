## Contributing

As Cozo is just getting started, we aim to keep everything simple.

Contributions to code or other materials
should be done via [pull requests](https://github.com/cozodb/cozo/pulls).

For code contributions other than simple bug fixes, please
[discuss](https://github.com/cozodb/cozo/discussions) it
first before opening a pull request,
otherwise it is unlikely to be accepted.
